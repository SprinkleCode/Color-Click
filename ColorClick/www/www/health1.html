    <p>It's thought that only white teen's are affected by eating disorders, but that's just a myth.  Anyone can be affected.
          It's not that teen's of color aren't affected. They're just less likely to seek treatment.  Recent studies have shown that eating
          disorders are on the rise in young women of color.  This could be from how pop culture portrays black women or from society telling us how we should look.
          At the end of the day, you should never feel less than beautiful in your own skin.  You don't need anyone telling you 
          what your beautiful is.  But if you're struggling, never be afraid to seek treatment. There is always someone who will help you. 
          But what if you are at an unhealthy weight and you're ready to make a change? Exercise and healthy eating are the way to go!
          150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise a week can make all the difference in your life.
          This exercise needs to be accompanied with healthy eating.  There are tons of recipes you can find online to help you in your journey.
          But remember, only go for it if you're ready and want to.  Not because someone told you to.

  <button class="accordion">Meet Your Goal </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Young teen girls are always trying to lose weight and stress out about it.
          You don't need a special diet like a low-carb or high-protein diet to lose weight.
          The best way to lose weight is to get the right mix of nutrients and energy your body needs.
          This is so you can feel great in your own body. It can be a bit harder for some people to lose 
          weight because of their genes or because of things around them, such as the food choices in their house. 
          But with the right support and a good plan, you can get to a healthy weight. It can be tough to need to lose weight. 
          At times, you may feel frustrated, angry, and other emotions. That's normal.
          While working to lose weight, remember to congratulate yourself for any successes. Don't 
          be so hard on your body.

    <button class="accordion">Relationships in the Real World</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Relationships are very good to have. Every relationship has value, regardless of how long it lasts.
    Rather it's with a family,friends, or boyfriend. Family is going always be there family sticks together. 
    They stand by each other during times of trouble and they will always have your back. Blood will always be thicker. 
    Friendships can come and go. A good friendship can last a lifetime. Even if ya'll are close, the closest of friends can 
    get into argument. To achieve a solid friendship, you have to be honest with each other. Don't be fake to each other 
    and talk behind eah other backs. Accept that they are human and that they
    will make mistakes. Then they're are boyfriends. Being in a relationship with a guy can sometimes be hard and also easy. 
    You need three things in a relationship trust, honesty, and communication. See the best in your partner and the relationship.
    As a teen don't try to hold on to a boyfriend if it isn't working. Don't let a boy break your heart because your heart is precious.
    because they come and go. </br></br>

  <button class="accordion">Staying Hydrated</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Throughout the day, you will lose water through many bodily functions. This includes things such
          as sweat and breathing.  Water is also involved in flushing toxins out of your body and providing a moist
          enviroment for your ears, throat, and mouth.  It's important to consume water to replace
          what you lost.  At some point, someone may have said to drink eight 8-ounce glasses of water per day.  While this is good 
          advice, and not far from what is really recommended, it's different for everyone.  The Insitute of Medicine reccommends 9 cups of water for women.
          It's also important to remember that water comes in many shapes in sizes.  You can find it in food or in drinks.  It might even be
          in your favorite food
