 <h3>Sexual Orientation & Gender Indentity</h3>
    <div class="container">
	<div class="row">



		   <p id="idpar">
		   	Sexual orientation is a person who is sexually, romantically, and emotionally attracted to. Sexual orientations include gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, pansexual, and questioning. The term bisexual means that a person is attracted to both females, and males. Asexuality is when a person is not sexually attracted to someone, and does not want a sexual relationship with someone but could have a romantic and emotional relationships with people.
		    Pansexuality is someone who's sexual, and romantic relationships is not limited to biological sex, gender, or gender identity. Those are just a few examples of the different kinds of sexual orientations, there are many more out there.
		    Now, gender indentity is not whp ypu are attracted to, but about who YOU ARE. Meaning, you can be genderqueer, transgender, cisgender, and etc. Cisgender is when a person's assigned
		    sex is the same gender they identify as. Transgender is when a person's assigned sex is different from the gender they identify as, and genderqueer is someone who can identify as anything other than cisgender.

		    As a black teen girl, there are many forms of disapproval from family, friends, and society in many ways. Some of those forms of disapproval can be about your sexual orientation and
		    gender identity. Due to these hindrances, it could be hard for a teen who is apart of the LGBTQ+ community to talk to her friends, and especially her family.
		    Even though these problems may occur, you should know that it's ok to be who YOU ARE! It's ok if you are not straight and cisgender, and it is ok if you are! Either way
		    your life is important, and you deserve to be who you truly are and live a happy fulfilled life. Don't let anyone tell you, you can't be something because they
		    don't believe in it or don't understand it. Be who you want to be and the right people will stay in your life, and will accept and support you.

		    To make it easier to cope with the changes in your life, and finding who you truly are, make sure you have safe spaces to go to. These safe spaces can be your friends, siblings, counselors, parents, or anyone you feel safe around.
		    Also, if you are not apart of the LGBTQ+ community, you should make sure you are being a trusted and supportive ally. An ally is someone who is heterosexual (straight), and cisgender who supports equal civil rughts, gender equality,
		    and challenges homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia. However, an ally does not have to indentify as heterosexual. So as someone who does not indentify themselves as apart of the LGBTQ+ community, it is
		    important that you make sure other black teen girls and anyone else who is apart of that community feel safe and valued. You are not better than nor deserve more respect than someone who is apart of the LGBTQ+ community.
		    ALL black teen girls are beautiful, and unique in their own way. And EVERY black teen girl deserves to be celebrated for being the only thing she can truly be, which is herself.
