<h3>Carrying Yourself</h3>

        Carrying yourself means that the way you represent yourself should be based
        on your own character. The way you carry yourself shows everyone who you are as a person. It shows
        them that that you are not ashamed to be black. African Americans should carry themselves with
        high respect towards themselves and one another. This is what carrying yourself with high standards
        and appreciation for black girls looks like.
        </p>
        <p id="carryingyourself2">
            A black girl has respect for herself and exemplifies high moral character.
            She is positive and spreads her positivity to everyone around her. Every time
            she is down, she is able to pick herself back up, weather its from help from
            others, or herself. Because she is all this, she never treats others in a way
            she wouldnt want to be treated.
