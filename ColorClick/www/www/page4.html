		     <p>Many young, african american females are judged because of their religous beliefs, but that is one of the many things that they are given when they are first born.
		     Black girls are more than likely to be christian, but there is also catholicism, islamic, baptism, atheism, ect. A females religious belief shouldn't describe
		     who they are because it's just a way of their living. Even if your one race you should still treat all the others equally, like they are they same religion.
