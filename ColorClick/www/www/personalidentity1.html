                     There are a variety of ways that young, black girls can express themselves. The biggest and most noticeable way they can express themselves is through their outward appearance, or known as, their style. This includes showing off their large, natural hair and fashionable, chic clothing that they own. Style is used in several different ways. Usually, teens use style to fit in with their friend group or other "popular" teens. Other teens or young people use style to represent themselves and show how unique they are in their own way. Black girls should use style to express their nationality and the special qualities they have. Us as black girls should be true to ourselves and portray our personalities through our style and not follow the crowd. A bad way that young girls portray style is by wearing inappropriate clothing that may expose their body too much in certain environments that aren't appropriate. While we are trying to look good in our clothing, we have to be aware of what we are wearing and where we're wearing it and make sure it looks respectable.
